### Aim of the Project

Main aim of this project is segmentation of paddy crops and weeds by images taken from UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle).

### Backgound

Weeds are plants that compete for nutrients, space, and light and exert many harmful effects by reducing the quality and quantity of crops if the weed population is uncontrolled. The direct yield loss has been estimated to be within the range of 16–86%, depending on the type of rice culture, weed species, and environmental conditions. Currently, farmers apply herbicides to control weeds. Excessive chemical usage will negatively affect the environment, crop productivity, and the economy.

In 2020 K.M.K.I Rathnayaka from the Department of Crop Science, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya has conducted a study of a Use of Multispectral UAV Images in Precision Agriculture: Weed Control in Rice. The study was conducted to develop maps for early detection of weed patches in broadcasted rice fields using images captured by a UAV.As a conclusion of the study, the Red-Green-Blue (RGB) reflectance maps generated with appropriate modifications made for parameters of the Excess Green (ExG) Index (2g-r-b) by using normalized values for G R and B (2G-R-B) selected from the Fix4DFields software, detected rice plants separately from three weed species as early as 21 days after broadcasting seed paddy. However, the results suggest that further improvements are necessary and also the Fix4DField software is a commercial software and hence very expensive making it a limitation in practical application.

In the present study we plan to continue the previous study by segmenting weeds and paddy crops using the machine learning techniques around semantic image segmentation to get more accurate results. Main application of this is to create a map of weeds in the rice field using UAVs. The generated maps can be used for site specific weed management and decision making purposes. A map-based system can help in directing the herbicide sprayer to specific areas and thereby minimize the herbicide usage. Producing a weed map is very challenging due to the similarity of the crops and the weeds. 

We plan to use the same dataset used by the previous study. The images had been taken from a Autonomous UAV.Flight mission using DJI Ground Station Pro® software to capture photographs with an overlap of 80% on the front and 70% on the sides (at 12.2 m above ground) with 25 minutes flight time . The UAV with a multispectral sensor had been flown to collect data over the experimental plots around 9.00 a.m. once in every three days from sowing to harvesting and additionally, on each sampling date. Flight way points of the set route were set to approximately 500. The number of photographed images was approximately 3000, and the image acquisition area was 0.13 ha (1350 m2). Plants were grown in field plots of 2.5 m × 6 m at the Rice Research and Development Institute, Batalagoda, Sri Lanka. Treatments were arranged as rice only, rice + weed species (3:2 plant density), and a weed species only in separate plots in three replicates.
